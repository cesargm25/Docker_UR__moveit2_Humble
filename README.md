# 🤖 Robot Integration
Current setup includes integration of UR3e with the Robotiq 2F-140 gripper using MoveIt 2. (Gazebo integration is in progress.)

Launch MoveIt with UR3e + Robotiq 2F-140:

```bash
ros2 launch ur3e_moveit_config demo.launch.py
```
View robot + gripper URDF (only visualization):
```bash
ros2 launch ur_description view_gripper.launch.py
```
MoveIt package name: ur3e_moveit_config

# URDF Files
There is no dedicated URDF package at the moment. Custom URDF and Xacro files are added directly into the existing ur_description package.
